Some things to think about. Here’s the result of your uninstall policy:
it doesn’t uninstall the app or the LaunchDaemon
I tried testing just the pkg that uninstalls the LaunchDaemon. Nope. Doesn’t uninstall.

That’s because the LaunchDaemon installer likely doesn’t have an uninstaller built in. Simply adding a .pkg to a policy and selecting “Uninstall” from the policy options screen doesn’t work, sadly. The installer (unless I’m sorely mistaken and the screenshot above seems to indicate that I’m not) has to support the uninstall process.

So now we have an app (which, btw, despite showing up as “Zoom Rooms” in /Applications, is actually not named “Zoom Rooms”, it’s called ZoomPresence.

this app needs to be deleted (but only if detected, otherwise the script will error out), then the LaunchDaemon needs to be unloaded, then disabled, then deleted (but again, only if detected).

and in all of this, we need to have some messages hitting the logs in Jamf.

Going to bed. Will likely need help testing this tomorrow if you’re available.
